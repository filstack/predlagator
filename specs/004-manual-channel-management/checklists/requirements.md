# Specification Quality Checklist: Управление каналами вручную

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

Все критерии качества спецификации выполнены. Спецификация готова для следующего этапа (`/speckit.clarify` или `/speckit.plan`).

### Details

**Content Quality**: ✅ All checks passed
- Specification is free from implementation details

- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ All checks passed
- No clarification markers present
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- All user stories have acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases comprehensively identified
- Scope is clearly defined
- Dependencies and assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ All checks passed
- Functional requirements linked to acceptance criteria via user stories
- Primary user flows covered: create, read, update, delete channels
- All success criteria are measurable outcomes

## Notes

- Specification quality validation completed successfully
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.clarify` (for refinement) or `/speckit.plan` (to begin planning implementation)
