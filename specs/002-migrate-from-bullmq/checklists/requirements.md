# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate to pg-boss PostgreSQL Queue

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- Spec focuses on "WHAT" (queue jobs, enforce rate limits, retry failures) without "HOW" (pg-boss library mentioned only as enabling technology)
- User scenarios describe operator workflows and business value (avoid Redis setup, prevent account bans, improve reliability)
- Language is accessible to non-developers (no code, no database schemas)
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- Zero clarification markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- Each FR is testable (e.g., "MUST queue jobs" → verify job appears in database)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (20 msg/sec, <10s pause response, 3 retry attempts)
- SC uses user-facing metrics (campaigns start without Redis, progress visible within 5s) not internal metrics
- 3 user stories × 3 acceptance scenarios each = 9 concrete test cases
- 7 edge cases identified covering connection loss, concurrency, crashes
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries (no WebSocket, no multi-worker, no monitoring UI)
- Assumptions section documents 8 key assumptions about infrastructure and requirements

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- FR-001 through FR-012 map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 3 user stories cover: basic queueing (P1), rate limiting (P2), retry logic (P3)
- 9 success criteria provide quantifiable targets for feature completion
- Spec remains implementation-agnostic (mentions pg-boss as choice but doesn't specify code structure)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

**Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization with P1/P2/P3 labels enables incremental delivery
2. Independent testability ensures each user story delivers standalone value
3. Comprehensive edge case coverage anticipates production scenarios
4. Measurable success criteria provide clear definition of done
5. Assumptions and out-of-scope explicitly stated to prevent scope creep

**Recommendations**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- During planning, validate pg-boss library capabilities against FR requirements
- Consider adding monitoring requirements in future iteration (currently out of scope)

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create technical design and implementation plan
2. Validate plan against constitution principles (Supabase-First, Queue Flexibility)
3. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate dependency-ordered task list
4. Begin implementation with User Story 1 (P1) for MVP
