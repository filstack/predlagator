# Specification Quality Checklist: Telegram Channel Broadcast Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results (Updated 2025-10-13)

### ✅ PASSED - Content Quality
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (operators, auditors, admins) and WHY (business value, safety, compliance)
- User scenarios remain technology-agnostic in outcomes (web interface behavior, not specific to React)
- Success criteria describe measurable outcomes (page load <3s, accessibility compliance, deployment success) without implementation details
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions

### ✅ PASSED - Requirement Completeness (Updated)
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- **Updated**: Functional requirements expanded to 67 total (was 41):
  - Original: FR-C01 through FR-I05 (41 requirements)
  - **NEW**: FR-I06 (JSONL parsing), FR-F01 through FR-F10 (10 frontend requirements), FR-V01 through FR-V10 (10 deployment requirements)
- **Updated**: Success criteria expanded to 18 (was 13):
  - Original: SC-001 through SC-013
  - **NEW**: SC-014 (page load performance), SC-015 (responsive design), SC-016 (accessibility), SC-017 (build time), SC-018 (Vercel limits)
- **Updated**: Assumptions expanded to 19 (was 12):
  - Original: A-001 through A-012
  - **NEW**: A-013 (JSONL format), A-014 (Vercel/backend split), A-015 (Git deployment), A-016 (external DB), A-017 (React/TypeScript), A-018 (shadcn UI), A-019 (operator skills)
- All 9 user stories remain with acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- 7 edge cases identified covering failure scenarios
- Scope bounded by prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) - MVP unchanged

### ✅ PASSED - Feature Readiness (Updated)
- Original functional requirements map to user stories (unchanged)
- **NEW**: Frontend requirements (FR-F01-F10) support all user story UI needs: catalog tables, batch management, message editor, campaign monitoring
- **NEW**: Deployment requirements (FR-V01-V10) ensure system can be hosted on Vercel free tier while respecting architecture constraints
- Feature measurable outcomes expanded: original criteria (SC-001 to SC-013) + new frontend/deployment criteria (SC-014 to SC-018)
- User scenarios remain technology-neutral - describe web interface behavior, not React specifics

## Notes

**All checklist items passed!**

The specification is **READY** for next phases:
- `/speckit.clarify` - Optional clarification workflow (currently not needed - no NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers)
- `/speckit.plan` - Implementation planning workflow (recommended next step)

## Review Summary (Updated 2025-10-13)

| Category | Status | Details |
| -------- | ------ | ------- |
| Content Quality | ✅ PASS | Business-focused, web interface outcomes (not React-specific), stakeholder-friendly |
| Requirement Completeness | ✅ PASS | **67 FRs** (was 41), **18 SCs** (was 13), 7 edge cases, **19 assumptions** (was 12) - all testable |
| Feature Readiness | ✅ PASS | 9 prioritized user stories unchanged, **NEW**: 10 frontend FRs + 10 deployment FRs |

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Added 26 new functional requirements (FR-I06, FR-F01-F10, FR-V01-V10)
- ✅ Added 5 new success criteria (SC-014 to SC-018) for frontend performance and deployment
- ✅ Added 7 new assumptions (A-013 to A-019) for React, shadcn, Vercel, JSONL format
- ✅ Channel data format documented: JSONL files in `batched_files/` with category folders

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan with:
- Frontend architecture (React + shadcn UI components)
- Backend architecture (Node.js/Express + GramJS workers)
- Deployment strategy (Vercel for UI + separate server for workers)
- JSONL import pipeline design
